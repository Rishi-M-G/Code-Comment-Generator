# Code-Comment-Generator
This project was created using Cohere Generate model to generate comments to codes that are given as input. This app is coded in python and hosted using streamlit platform.

##Introduction
Comments in coding are lines within the source code that are not executed by the compiler but serve as human-readable explanations or documentation for the code. They play a crucial role in enhancing code comprehension, facilitating collaboration, easing onboarding for new developers, and streamlining code review and debugging.

Despite their importance, many developers do not consistently comment on their code for various reasons. This code comment generator aims to address this issue by automatically generating relevant comments for a given code.

## Benefits of Comments
- Improved documentation quality.
- Reduced developer workload.
- Enhanced collaboration.
- Adherence to coding standards.

### Step 1: Install and Import Dependencies

If you are using Python, install Cohere and Streamlit using the following pip commands:
```bash
pip install cohere
pip install streamlit
